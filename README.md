Get your qoute of the day everyday.
there will be . First the signup page. Then comes the signin/login page. Then the user dashboard. Then hompage. hompage will have
section to generate random thoughts, and random qoutes. user can mark somr of the ideas as favourite and those ideas/qoutes willbe saved in the user data, can be seen in the user dashboard. 

In further development phases I will add filters and search methods that will enhance the experience.

For now I will be using the qoute generator api, later I will think of writing the logic by myself.# Qoutes_Generator
